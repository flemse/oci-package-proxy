# Python PyPI Implementation

## Overview

The Python PyPI implementation in the OCI Package Proxy should support the PyPI package protocol, enabling seamless interaction between Python package managers (e.g., pip) and the OCI registry.

## Key Features

1. **Package Upload**: Support for uploading Python packages to the OCI registry.
2. **Package Download**: Enable downloading Python packages from the OCI registry.
3. **Metadata Handling**: Manage package metadata, including name, version, dependencies, and supported platforms.
4. **Search and Indexing**: Provide search functionality for packages stored in the OCI registry.
5. **Authentication**: Implement authentication mechanisms for secure access to the registry.

## Workflow

1. **Request Handling**:
   - Routes defined in `pkg/registries/python/registry.go` handle PyPI requests for package upload, download, and metadata retrieval.
2. **Mapping**:
   - Uses the mapper construct to translate package identifiers into OCI-compatible paths.
3. **Registry Interaction**:
   - Uploads and downloads are managed using OCI storage operations defined in `pkg/store/oci.go`.

### Authentication

Authentication is implemented using credentials extracted from HTTP requests, as defined in `pkg/registries/python/registry.go`.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional PyPI features, such as package signing.
- Improved search capabilities.
- Enhanced security measures for package uploads and downloads.
