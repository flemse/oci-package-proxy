# Terraform Provider Implementation

## Overview

The Terraform provider implementation in the OCI Package Proxy enables seamless interaction between Terraform and the OCI registry. It supports the Terraform provider protocol, allowing providers to be stored and retrieved as OCI artifacts.

## Key Features

1. **Provider Upload**: Support for uploading Terraform providers to the OCI registry.
2. **Provider Download**: Enable downloading Terraform providers from the OCI registry.
3. **Metadata Handling**: Manage provider metadata, including name, version, and supported platforms.
4. **Authentication**: Implement authentication mechanisms for secure access to the registry.

## Workflow

1. **Request Handling**:
   - Routes defined in `pkg/registries/terraform/registry.go` handle Terraform provider requests for discovery, versioning, and downloads.
2. **Mapping**:
   - Uses the mapper construct to translate provider identifiers into OCI-compatible paths.
3. **Registry Interaction**:
   - Uploads and downloads are managed using OCI storage operations defined in `pkg/store/oci.go`.

## Authentication

Authentication is implemented using credentials extracted from HTTP requests, as defined in `pkg/registries/terraform/registry.go`.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional Terraform features, such as module storage.
- Improved search capabilities for providers.
- Enhanced security measures for provider uploads and downloads.
